        <h1>Custom Membership provider</h1>
    <p>While the user System.Web.Profile provides a convenient mechanism for storing information per user in a Web application, the design of your application might require that additional user information be stored with the user authentication information in the Membership data store. In this case, you would need to build a custom membership provider to store and retrieve the user authentication information and the additional user values in your data store (for an example of a custom membership provider, see Implementing a Membership Provider). Additionally, you can extend the MembershipUser class to make the added user values available to application code.</p>
